            From your 15 player squad, select 11 players by the Gameweek
            deadline to form your team.
          </p>
          <p className="about-paragraph">
            All your points for the Gameweek will be scored by these 11 players,
            however if one or more doesn't play they may be automatically
            substituted.
          </p>
          <p className="about-paragraph">
            Your team can play in any formation providing that 1 goalkeeper, at
            least 3 defenders and at least 1 forward are selected at all times.

          <p className="about-paragraph">

          <p className="about-paragraph">

            Prioritising Your Bench For Automatic Substitutions
          </h6>
          <p className="about-paragraph">
            Your substitutes provide cover for unforeseen events like injuries
            and postponements by automatically replacing starting players who
            don't play in a Gameweek.
          </p>
          <p className="about-paragraph">
            Playing in a Gameweek means playing at least 1 minute or receiving a
            yellow / red card.
          </p>
          <p className="about-paragraph">
            Based on the priorities you assign, automatic substitutions are
            processed at the end of the Gameweek as follows:
            <ul className="about-list">
              <li>
                If your Goalkeeper doesn't play in the Gameweek, he will be
                substituted by your replacement Goalkeeper, if he played in the
                Gameweek.
              </li>
              <li>
                If any of your outfield players don't play in the Gameweek, they
                will be substituted by the highest priority outfield substitute
                who played in the Gameweek and doesn't break the formation rules
                (eg. If your starting team has 3 defenders, a defender can only
                be replaced by another defender).
              </li>
            </ul>
